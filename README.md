## Hi there 👋

I’m Jelle, a student programmer and basketball player based in Belgium.

If an idea hits me, there’s a good chance I’ll prototype it the same day.
I’m focused on improving my programming skills and turning ideas into real projects.

My main tech stack includes C#, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and I’m constantly expanding my skills.
My favorite tools are VS Code and WebStorm.

I’m currently leveling up, building new projects, and experimenting with whatever inspires me.

You can find some of my favorite projects pinned below — and there are plenty more in the works.

My dream is to become successful through building, creating, and learning
If you want to see what I’m building next, stick around.

Fun Facts:

I train basketball almost every day

I want to move to the US in the future

Hobbies: gym, coding, and making cool stuff
